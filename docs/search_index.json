In brief, it contains three parts: the metabolome, microbiota and inter-omics analyses. For the metabolome, we include detailed descriptions of the metabolomics data acquisition, data processing with xcms, and multivariate analyses with ropls. In addition, signals of known and novel compounds of interest were manually extracted and analysed. For the microbiota, we include community visualisation and ecological analyses in vegan. The inter-omics section contains mantel test and procrustes rotations, as well as the microbial interaction network annotated with the OTU’s correlation with barettin, and their response to depth. 1.1 Experimental setup Three demosponge species Geodia barretti (n=20), Stryphnus fortis (n=15), and Weberella bursa (n=17) were sampled in the Davis Strait between Canada and Greenland (61.147942-66.38245 Lat,-68.78077- -57.96573 Lon) from 244 m to 1467 m depth. Temperature and salinity in situ were recorded.
